# Stock-Tracker

I am currently working on a Stock Tacker application for my personal use. The main point is to track and visualize the dividend and price changes of my stocks. Also, to make decisions from historic data.
The data is coming from JSON file witch I got from Yahoo Finance. I use a local SQL server to store my data, but later I want to use a cloud-based SQL server. 
In the next version I plan to improve my application and track not just dividend, but price changes and historic data too. Beside that I want to create multiple Power BI visualization.

Note:
The picture is just to show the results of my program and it doesn’t represent my Portfolio and It’s not a finance advise.
